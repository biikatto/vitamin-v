-remove lpb from pattern; this should be a global parameter and be adjustable via pattern fx cmd
-on that note, how would per-pattern bpm even work? maybe I can add this later, but it should be removed for now

-think about timing; audio interface sample clock? rtaudio

-Goal: MIDI!!! rtmidi, w rtaudio timing
