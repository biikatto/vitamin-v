The \hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio} A\+PI incorporates many of the concepts developed in the \href{http://www.portaudio.com/}{\tt Port\+Audio} project by Phil Burk and Ross Bencina. Early development also incorporated ideas from Bill Schottstaedt\textquotesingle{}s \href{http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/sndlib/}{\tt sndlib}. The C\+C\+R\+MA \href{http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/groups/soundwire/}{\tt Sound\+Wire group} provided valuable feedback during the A\+PI proposal stages.

The early 2.\+0 version of \hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio} was slowly developed over the course of many months while in residence at the \href{http://www.iua.upf.es/}{\tt Institut Universitari de L\textquotesingle{}Audiovisual (I\+UA)} in Barcelona, Spain and the \href{http://www.acoustics.hut.fi/}{\tt Laboratory of Acoustics and Audio Signal Processing} at the Helsinki University of Technology, Finland. Much subsequent development happened while working at the \href{http://www-ccrma.stanford.edu/}{\tt Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (C\+C\+R\+MA)} at \href{http://www.stanford.edu/}{\tt Stanford University}. All recent versions of \hyperlink{class_rt_audio}{Rt\+Audio} have been completed while working as an assistant / associate professor of \href{http://www.music.mcgill.ca/musictech/}{\tt Music Technology} at \href{http://www.mcgill.ca/}{\tt Mc\+Gill University}. This work was supported in part by the United States Air Force Office of Scientific Research (grant \#F49620-\/99-\/1-\/0293).
